# libft
Introduction
Programming in C is a very laborious activity when you do not have access to
all these little usual very practical functions. This is why we offer you
through this project to take the time to rewrite these functions, to understand them and
to make them yours. You can then reuse your library to work
effectively on your following C projects.
This project is also an opportunity for you to extend the list of requested functions
with yours and thus make your library even more useful. Feel free to
complete your libft throughout your schooling once this project is gone
only a memory for you.
